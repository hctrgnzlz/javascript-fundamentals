//Coding Challenge #1

/* Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
m tall.

GOOD LUCK 


const weightMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const weightJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

const BMIMark = weightMark / heightMark ** 2;
const BMIJohn = weightJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);
const markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn;
console.log(BMIJohn, BMIMark, markHigherBMI)

//Coding Challenge #2

/*
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and 
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message 
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement 

GOOD LUCK



const johnBMI = 23.9;
const markBMI = 28.3;

if (markBMI >= johnBMI) {
    console.log (`Mark's BMI is higher than Johns`)
} else {
    console.log (`Mark's BMI IS NOT HIIGHER`)
}



const weightMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const weightJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

const BMIMark = weightMark / heightMark ** 2;
const BMIJohn = weightJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);


if (BMIMark > BMIJohn) {
    console.log(`Mark's BMI(${BMIMark}) is higher than John's (${BMIJohn})!`)
} else {
    console.log(`NO`)
}
